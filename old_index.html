				<h2>Introduction</h2>
				<p>I am a foodie and a wanna-be food critic. Food is the best way to start any relationship. That's how I met my wife. My family is important to me. God has blessed me with a beautiful, supportive wife and a cutiful, gorgeous baby girl. I love God, my family, and my country.</p>
			</div>

			<div id="origin">
				<h2>How I got here</h2>
				<p>I was born and raised in Jakarta, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesia" target="_blank">Indonesia</a>. It is the biggest archipelago nation with over 13,000 islands. It looks like an "island bridge" that connects Asia and Australia. The Phillipines is just above us.</p>
				<p>My stay in the United States began in 2005 when I attended Pensacola Christian College in Florida. I fell in love with America and decided to become a Permanent Resident. I claim to be from Indonesia, Florida, and Texas (lived there for a year or so).</p>

			<div id="about_me">
				<h2>About me</h2>
				<h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
				<p>I love creating aesthetically-pleasing websites. I could sit for a whole day coding, learning, and tweaking details. When I'm in the zone, my wife has to remind me every 30 minutes or so that I have a family, that we have companies, or that dinner is getting cold.</p>
				<p>I enjoy video games. But, I only play select games that involve a lot of thinking, strategizing, and planning such as Football Manager, FIFA, and Counter-Strike.</p>
				<p>When finance is not an issue, I love to travel and try out delicious food.</p>
				<h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
				<p>Besides getting paid to eat and write about amazing food, I would love to own a tech company that replaces Apple's and Microsoft's influence in people's lives.</p>
				<h3>What music have you been listening to lately?</h3>
				<p>Now that you ask, I realized I haven't been listening to any music for the last few weeks. Or is it months? The last time I remember consciously tuning into music was Christmas. Oh no!</p>
				<h3>What's your short-term goal?</h3>
				<p>I want to start a career in web development as a Front-End engineer. I want to gain experience and mastery of front-end skills before delving more into back-end skills to become a full-stack developer.</p>
				<h3>What are you doing right now?</h3>
				<p>I'm working as a <a href="http://www.pcci.edu/campus/facilities/planetarium.aspx" target="_blank">Planetarium</a> Programmer (think of HTML, CSS, jQuery but on 3D space and a hemispherical dome) for Pensacola Christian College. I am also enrolled in <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>'s Front-End Web Development <a href="http://www.thinkful.com/courses/learn-web-development-online" target="_blank">course</a> to prepare me for a career change in the summer.
