			<p>I'm Vicky, an aspiring Front-End Web Developer with Computer Science degree who's excited to jump start my career in web development. I love beautiful, yet simple websites (I think I just appreciate aesthetics in general). My passion is to create them and make them work. I've been calling Pensacola, FL home for almost a decade, but I'm looking forward to live in a bigger city with my wife and my little daughter.</p>

		<h2>More Details</h2>
		<div class="main-container">
			<h3>What are you doing right now?</h3>
			<p>I work full-time as a Planetarium Programmer for Pensacola Christian College, where I use DigitalSky2 to make visuals for planetarium showings. Outside of work, I'm spending time with my family and taking online courses from Thinkful. The first course was Front-End Development, which covered basic front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, API, Git, and Responsive Design. Given my background, I was able to complete the course in one-third of the estimated time. After completing Intermediate JavaScript and Angular courses seven weeks later, I am now ready to look for a Junior Developer role.</p>
			<h3>How did you get here?</h3>
			<p>I came to the United States to attend Pensacola Christian College at age 16. Before that, I lived in Indonesia. I graduated with my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science/Software Engineering in 2009. Since then, I've moved to Dallas and back again to Pensacola, where I finished my Master's in Divinity in 2014. I've been working as a Planetarium Programmer since the start of my post-graduate schooling, when I started off as a part-time graduate assistant, until now.</p>
			<p>
			<h3>What are you planning to do?</h3>
			<p>Working in the Planetarium has made me realize how much I enjoy good visuals. I see the Web as a bigger opportunity to express myself. With established solid understanding of Front-End skills and tools, I'm hoping to work with a company that posseses the same drive to grow and succeed as I do.</p>
			<h3>Do you have any hobbies?</h3>
			<p>Yes, even though it's difficult to find the time or means for one at the present. I enjoy soccer, music, food, and travel. I would travel just to eat good food all around the country. Imagine a culinary road trip across the US. Let me know if you're going.</p>
